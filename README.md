# New-York-City-Bike


Project looks at 2015 data for New York's city bike program. The bike sharing program uploads their data at 
https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html


Included in the repo is a jupyter notebook of data cleaning. Removed about 1 million rows of data, renamed gender column and concatenated 2015 csvs into one. 
Cannot upload 2015 csv data because it is too large. 


Tableau visualizations can be viewed here.
